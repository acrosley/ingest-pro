[00:00] Speaker A: Yes, Alex, I was trying to see if you want to pick up this case. My name is Albert Vasquez. On the 23rd of May, I went to the Methodist Hospital downtown, and I was complaining about chest pain that would cause her ulcer and. And something else. It wasn't no heart attack, but being there, they noted that they had a. I had a ulcer on my leg. The wounded wasn't going away, so they claim that they wouldn't fix it if I would get a procedure where they put rods down my legs and open the veins up. But ever since that, I'm not able to walk or nothing. Right now, I'm just laying in bed.
[00:00] Speaker B: Okay, and are you still in the hospital right now?
[00:00] Speaker A: No, I came out on the 23rd of this month.
[01:01] Speaker B: So, unfortunately, we are personal injury, but we mostly do things that involve, like, motor vehicle accidents, so we don't really do medical malpractice cases. Okay, but do you happen to have the phone number for the San Antonio Bar Association?
[01:01] Speaker A: No, ma', am, but I get my daughter to call it.
[01:01] Speaker B: Yeah, I can go ahead and give you that phone number.
[01:01] Speaker A: Let me see. Let me get. And they. They got different. Different numbers to call.
[01:01] Speaker B: So what they do is they'll have, like, a referral service, so you can give them a call and ask for it. You give them a little bit about the case that you're wanting to pursue, and they may be able to pair you up with a more suitable.
[01:01] Speaker A: Okay, that sounds great.
[01:01] Speaker B: Okay.
[01:01] Speaker A: Yeah, I just want to get up and go move around. I don't want to lay down, you know, all my life and just being handicapped.
[02:02] Speaker B: No, of course.
[02:02] Speaker A: So what's the number? 210.
[02:02] Speaker B: Yes.
[02:02] Speaker A: 227-88-2222. Okay, ma'. Am. 227-8822.
[02:02] Speaker B: Correct. Yeah. And you can just give them a call and ask for their referral service.
