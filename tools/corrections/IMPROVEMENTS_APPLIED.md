# 🎯 Major Improvements Applied

Based on 239 approvals from 4 minutes of audio (~600 words), I've optimized the review system.

## 📊 The Problem

**Before:** 239 approvals / ~600 words = **40% false positive rate**

Most flagged words were common English words at 80-86% confidence - way too high!

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Lowered Confidence Thresholds**

**Regular Words:**
- **Before:** 70% threshold → Flagged "a", "and", "to" at 80-86%
- **After:** 60% threshold → Only flags genuinely low confidence

**Common Words:**
- **Before:** 30% threshold  
- **After:** 25% threshold → Even more lenient for ultra-common words

### 2. **Expanded Common Words List** (60+ new words added)

**Added action verbs:**
- Get, Got, Give, Go, Want, Need, See, Make, Take, Know, Think, Say, Tell, Ask, Call, Try

**Added call center vocabulary:**
- Please, Press, If, Then, Just, Request, Through, Medical, Department, Release, Information, Number, Office, Record, Records, Patient

**Added days of week:**
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

### 3. **Added Location Names to Dictionary**

Added to `config/nouns_to_expect.txt`:
- Santa Rosa
- Santa Rosa Hospital  
- Christus Santa Rosa
- Westover Hills
- Westover
- Santa, Rosa, Hills (individual components)
- Carlos (agent name)

## 📈 Expected Results

### **Next test should show:**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Approvals** | 239 | ~40-60 | -75% ⬇️ |
| **False Positive Rate** | 40% | ~7-10% | -30% ⬇️ |
| **Flags Per Minute** | ~60 | ~10-15 | -75% ⬇️ |

### **What Will Still Be Flagged:**
✓ Actual names not in dictionary  
✓ Phone numbers  
✓ Critical confidence (< 50%)  
✓ Money amounts  
✓ Case numbers  
✓ Genuine transcription errors  

### **What Will No Longer Be Flagged:**
✗ Common words like "a", "and", "to", "of" at 80%+ confidence  
✗ Action words like "get", "want", "please" at 75%+ confidence  
✗ Medical/office terms like "medical", "department", "release"  
✗ Location names in the dictionary  
✗ Days of the week

## 🧪 Test Plan

1. **Re-process your 2-minute test file:**
   ```batch
   python processor.py demo\Audio\your_file.wav
   ```

2. **Load in review UI**

3. **Expected outcome:**
   - Should see ~15-20 flags (down from 66-80)
   - Most should be legitimate (names, numbers, critical issues)
   - Very few "obvious" common words

4. **If you still approve 10+ common words:**
   - Run `view_approvals.bat`
   - I'll lower thresholds further or add more words

## 💡 Progressive Refinement Strategy

The system is now set to learn from your actual usage:

**Week 1 (Current):** 
- Threshold: 60% regular, 25% common
- Expected: ~10-15 flags per minute

**Week 2 (If needed):**
- Lower to 55% regular, 20% common  
- Expected: ~5-10 flags per minute

**Week 3+ (Maintenance):**
- Add domain-specific terms as you discover them
- Fine-tune based on your comfort level
- Track with `view_approvals.bat`

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **AssemblyAI is confident about common words** - They naturally score 75-90% even though they're short. This is GOOD confidence, not bad.

2. **70% threshold was too strict** - Catching way too many correct transcriptions of simple words.

3. **Context matters** - "Medical", "department", "release" are ultra-common in your domain and should never be flagged.

4. **Location names are consistent** - "Christus Santa Rosa Westover Hills" appears frequently - now in dictionary.

---

## 📝 Recommendations

### **After testing, if you're happy with results:**

1. **Document your settings** in a permanent config file
2. **Train your team** on when to flag vs. approve
3. **Set up monthly reviews** - run `view_approvals.bat` monthly to catch new patterns
4. **Build domain dictionary** - Add client names, medical facilities, local places as you discover them

### **If still too many flags:**

Let me know and I'll:
- Lower thresholds to 55%
- Add more context-specific vocabulary
- Adjust specific flag types

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these over time:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Approvals per minute | < 5 |
| False positive rate | < 10% |
| Review time per call | < 2 minutes |
| Corrections per call | < 3 |

When you hit these targets consistently, the system is dialed in! 🎉
