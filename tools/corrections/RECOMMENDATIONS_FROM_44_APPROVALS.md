# üìä Recommendations from 44 Approvals

## üîç Analysis

You approved 44 words in a 2.5-minute call. Here's what this tells us:

### ‚ùå **Problem: Common words flagged unnecessarily**

Words like "and", "by", "is", "have", "a", "just", "if" are being flagged at 44-65% confidence. These are **ultra-common English words** that should almost never be flagged.

## ‚úÖ Recommended Actions

### 1. Lower Common Words Threshold (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current:** `commonWords: 0.40` (40%)  
**Recommended:** `commonWords: 0.30` or even `0.25`

**Why:** Common words like "and", "the", "is" are being flagged at 44-60% confidence. At this range, AssemblyAI is still pretty confident - these words are just naturally lower confidence because they're short and frequent.

**How to fix:**

#### JavaScript UI:
Edit `tools/review_tools/assemblyai_review_ui.html` line 550:
```javascript
confidence: {
    critical: 0.50,
    low: 0.70,
    commonWords: 0.30,  // Change from 0.40 to 0.30
},
```

#### Python Generator:
Edit `tools/review_tools/assemblyai_review_generator.py` line 36:
```python
common_words_confidence_threshold: float = 0.30  # Change from 0.40 to 0.30
```

### 2. Add More Conversational Words

Add these to the common words list (they're missing):

**Missing words:** "Okay" (with period), "Yeah" (with period), "Thanks", "Yes" (with comma)

**How to fix:**

Edit both files and add to the common words array/set:
- `'Okay.'` (note the period)
- `'Yes,'` (note the comma)
- `'Yeah.'` (note the period)

**Note:** Punctuation matters! "Okay" and "Okay." are treated differently.

### 3. Add Healthcare Terms to Dictionary

**Words to add to `config/nouns_to_expect.txt`:**
```
Methodist
Methodist Hospital
Hospital
downtown
```

---

### 4. Consider Phone-Specific Common Words

In phone conversations, these are ultra-common and should maybe be in the common words list:
- `ma'am`
- `sir` (if you see it)

---

## üìà Expected Improvement

After these changes, you should see:
- **~35-40 fewer flags** on similar calls (most of your approvals were common words)
- **Only ~5-10 flags per 2.5 min call** (names, numbers, critical confidence)
- **Better signal-to-noise ratio** - flags will be more meaningful

---

## üß™ Testing

1. Make the changes above
2. Process the same audio file again
3. Compare results:
   - **Before:** 44 words flagged
   - **After:** Should be ~5-10 words flagged

---

## üí° Long-term Strategy

As you review more calls:
1. **Track approval patterns** - if you're approving the same word 3+ times, it shouldn't be flagged
2. **Build domain-specific dictionary** - legal/medical terms, local place names, etc.
3. **Gradually lower thresholds** - start conservative, adjust based on your comfort level

---

## üéØ Quick Win

**Immediate action** (1 minute):
1. Change `commonWords: 0.40` to `commonWords: 0.30` in both files
2. Add "Methodist Hospital" to `config/nouns_to_expect.txt`
3. Re-process your test file

**Expected result:** Flags should drop from 44 to ~10-15

This is exactly why we built the corrections tracking system! üéâ
