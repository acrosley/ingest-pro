# AssemblyAI Manual Review System

A dedicated manual review engine optimized for AssemblyAI transcripts, providing intelligent flagging and correction capabilities.

## Overview

The AssemblyAI Review System provides:
- **Native AssemblyAI Integration**: Uses confidence scores directly from AssemblyAI (no Whisper alignment needed)
- **Smart Pattern Detection**: Automatically flags phone numbers, dates, money amounts, names, and more
- **Priority-Based Flagging**: High/medium/low priority flags help you focus on critical corrections
- **Interactive Web UI**: Modern, user-friendly interface for reviewing and correcting transcripts
- **Correction Tracking**: Save and export your corrections with full audit trails

## Key Features

### Automatic Flagging

The system automatically flags words for review based on:

#### Confidence-Based Flags
- **Critical Confidence** (< 50%): Very low confidence - needs immediate review
- **Low Confidence** (< 70%): Below threshold - should be reviewed

#### Pattern-Based Flags
- **Phone Numbers**: Both formatted (210-555-1234) and spelled-out (2-1-0 5-5-5...)
- **Case Numbers**: 6+ digit sequences that could be case identifiers
- **Money Amounts**: Dollar amounts and financial figures
- **Dates**: Date mentions in various formats
- **Times**: Appointment times and time mentions
- **Names**: Capitalized words likely to be proper nouns
- **Numbers**: Any numeric content for accuracy verification

### Priority System

**High Priority** (ðŸ”´ Red):
- Critical confidence issues (< 50%)
- Phone numbers
- Case numbers
- Spelled-out number sequences

**Medium Priority** (ðŸŸ  Orange):
- Low confidence (50-70%)
- Money amounts
- Dates
- Names/proper nouns

**Low Priority** (ðŸ”µ Blue):
- General numbers
- Minor confidence issues

## Usage

### Automatic Review Generation

When using AssemblyAI as your transcription engine, reviews are automatically generated during processing:

1. Audio file is transcribed by AssemblyAI
2. Confidence JSON is saved with word-level data
3. Review file is automatically generated
4. Review JSON includes all flagged words with context

### Manual Review Generation

Generate a review for an existing transcript:

```bash
cd tools/review_tools
python assemblyai_review_generator.py path/to/transcript.confidence.json path/to/transcript.txt
```

### Launching the Review UI

#### Option 1: Batch File (Windows)
```bash
cd tools/review_tools
launch_assemblyai_review.bat
```

#### Option 2: Python Script
```bash
cd tools/review_tools
python launch_assemblyai_review.py
```

The UI will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8002`

## Configuration

Configure review settings in `config/call_pipeline.ini`:

```ini
[Review]
# Enable/disable review generation
Enabled = true

# Output directory for review files
OutputDirectory = .\output\Review

# Confidence threshold for flagging (0.0-1.0)
LowConfidenceThreshold = 0.70

# Pattern detection flags
FlagNumbers = true
```

## Integration with Pipeline

The AssemblyAI review system integrates automatically:

1. **Transcription** â†’ AssemblyAI transcribes audio
2. **Confidence Export** â†’ Word-level confidence saved
3. **Review Generation** â†’ Automatic flagging and analysis
4. **Manual Review** â†’ You review and correct flagged words
5. **Export** â†’ Corrected transcript ready for use

## Best Practices

### Review Strategy

1. **Start with High Priority**: Address critical issues first
2. **Use Filters**: Focus on specific types (phone numbers, names, etc.)
3. **Check Context**: Always read surrounding words
4. **Listen to Audio**: If available, verify against original audio
5. **Save Regularly**: Use Ctrl+S or "Save Review File" frequently

### Common Scenarios

**Phone Numbers**: Always verify digit-by-digit, especially for spelled-out sequences

**Names**: Check against your staff_map.txt and nouns_to_expect.txt

**Case Numbers**: Critical for legal work - verify every digit

**Money Amounts**: Confirm exact amounts with context

**Dates/Times**: Verify appointment and deadline dates carefully

### Quality Assurance

- Review 100% of high-priority flags
- Sample-check medium and low priority flags
- Compare overall confidence with review results
- Track correction patterns to improve expected terms list

## Troubleshooting

### UI Won't Load
- Check that port 8002 is available
- Try manually opening the HTML file
- Check browser console for errors

### No Flags Showing
- Verify the review file has a "words" array
- Check filter settings (show only flagged might be hiding words)
- Ensure confidence JSON was properly generated

### Corrections Not Saving
- Check file permissions in output directory
- Ensure you clicked "Apply" before saving
- Verify JSON structure is valid
